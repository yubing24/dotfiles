* My Awesome Linux Configurations
Steps:
** Make Symbolic Links

I can either make those links manually, which is a pain, or use a management software, such as GNU Stow
*** Bash
```
$ ln -sf ~/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
```
*** Emacs
```
$ rm -rf .emacs.d # remove existing folder to prevent creating dummy link
$ ln -sf ~/dotfiles/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
```
*** Other Configs
```
$ ln -sf ~/dotfiles/config/<folder name> .config/
```
